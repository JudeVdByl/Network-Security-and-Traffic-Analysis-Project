# Wireshark-Network-Traffic-Analysis-Project
This project documents the process and results of a comprehensive network traffic analysis, involving multiple packet capture (PCAP) files and tasks. I used Wireshark to filter traffic, analyze protocols, and investigate various network events, including DNS queries, TCP scans, ICMP tunneling, and FTP login attempts.
